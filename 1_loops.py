# Example Practice:
# Given this list of fruits:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
print(fruits[0])
print(fruits[1])
print(fruits[2])
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# i just worked with loops

# Given a list of school subjects:
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
# for subject in subjects:
#     print(subject)
# #print out each subject but stop when you hit history

# for x in subjects:
#     if x == "History":
#         break
#     else:
#         print(x)

# for x in subjects:
#     if x == "Science":
#         continue
#     else:
#         print(x)

for i in range(len(subjects)):
    print(f"Subject {i}: {subjects[1]}")




# Challenge:
# Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
# Example output: "Subject 0: Math"


# Given:
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.


total = 0 
for numbers in numbers:
    total += numbers
print(total)
