# # **Python Practice Problems (No Code Included)

# **Directions:** Solve each problem by writing your own Python code. Show outputs where required.


# ### **Problem 1: Print Numbers 1 to 10

# Write a program that prints the numbers from **1 to 10**, each on a new line.

# for x in range(1,11):
#     print(x)

# # ### **Problem 2: Sum of Numbers

# # Ask the user for a number **n**, then calculate and display the **sum of all numbers from 1 to n**.

# num = int(input("Print any number: "))
# sum = 0
# for number in range(1, num+1):
#     sum += number
# print("The sum of the numbers from 1 to", num, "is", sum)


# ### **Problem 3: Factorial Calculator

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then calculate the **factorial** of that number.

# *(Example: factorial of 5 is 120)

# j = int(input("Print any number: "))

# def factorial(n):

#     factorial = 1

#     for i in range (n):
#         factorial *= i +1





#     return factorial

# print(factorial(j))


# ### **Problem 4: Count Vowels**

# Ask the user for a string. Count and print how many **vowels (a, e, i, o, u)** are in the string.


# ### **Problem 5: Print Even Numbers**

# # Ask the user for a number **n**, then print all **even numbers** from 2 up to n.

# n = int(input("Pick a number: "))

# for x in range(0,n+1,2):
#     print(x)

# ### **Problem 6: Reverse a String**

# Ask the user for a string, then print the string **backwards**.

# name = input("enter a string: ")
# reversed_name = ""
# for char in name:
#     reversed_name = char + reversed_name

# print(reversed_name)
# # ### **Problem 7: Multiplication Table**

# # Ask the user for a number **n**, then print the **multiplication table** for n from
# # n × 1 up to n × 10.



# ### **Problem 8: Count Occurrences**

# Ask the user for **two strings**, a and b.
# Determine how many times **string b appears inside string a**.



# ### **Problem 9: Fibonacci Sequence**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print the first **n numbers** of the Fibonacci sequence.

def fibbonacci(n):


    if n==1 or n==2 :
        return 1
    

    return fibbonacci(n-1)+fibbonacci(n-2)

for i in range(1,10):
    print(fibbonacci(i))










# ### **Problem 10: Pattern Printing**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print a pattern of stars where the first row has 1 star, the second has 2, and so on until row n.

# *(Example for n = 4)*
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
